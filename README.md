# ADND2DB
A (set of) database(s) for AD&amp;D version 2 based on the [Players' Handbook](./DD_Players_Handbook) and [Charles W. Plemons III's Weapons List](https://people.wku.edu/charles.plemons/ad&d/misc/arms.html) (Credits for that data go to him)

Use [Getitem](./getitem.py) for item retrieval from text (does deep matching & always finds what you need, if it's in the database)
